# Distributed-storage-systems-using-MPI.
Implemented a distributed storage systems using MPI. The distributed file storage system in this assignment consists of master node (node 0) and data-storage nodes (non-zero ranks). The job of the master node is to communicate with the data-storage nodes using MPI for data storage and retrieval. The master node also provides an API to the clients so that they store and retrieve their files.
